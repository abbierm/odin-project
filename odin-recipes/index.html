    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>My philosophy on my diet is to keep it simple.  I have a weird dichotomy where half the day I'm relatively sedentary and learning how to program while the other half I'm actively training to be a better rock climber. I need enough energy to train but I still try and actively monitor my caloric intake and keep it around 1800 kCal. Generally, I eat the same breakfast and lunch every day and occasionally mix the dinner up based on what I have available. Since I am so strict with my diet during a normal day, I let myself splurge when on the rare occasion I go out or am visiting family.</p>
        <p>For reference, I am a 5'4 (163 cm) 33 year old female and weigh around 120-125 lbs (55 - 57 kg).</p>
